		<p>Students for Liberty is a non-partisan political student organization at UC Berkeley dedicated to promoting the ideas of minimal government, free markets, sound money, non-intervention, and maximum individual liberty to campus and the surrounding community. We spread our message through weekly internal club meetings, external debates with other student organizations, speaker events, rallies, and tabling on Sproul Plaza.</p>

		<p>In the club’s first year alone, they held over twenty meetings, hosted seven speaker events, participated in two debates, and organized one rally—a level of activity that surpassed the established political clubs on campus, despite having a budget of only $150.</p>

		<p>We hold regular meetings most Thursdays of the school year from 7 to 8:30 pm at a location on campus. At our meetings, we typically engage in a group discussion on political philosophy, concluding with a casual social event afterwards. In the true spirit of freedom, our meetings are open to all regardless of student status or political affiliation.</p>

		<p>In addition to our weekly meetings, Students for Liberty holds several special events throughout the semester intended to bring the message of freedom to Berkeley’s greater community. All events and meetings are announced on our website, email Listserv, and Facebook page.</p>
